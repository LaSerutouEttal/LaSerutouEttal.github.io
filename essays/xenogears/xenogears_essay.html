    <h1><strong>Why I Like Xenogears: A Spoiler-Free Essay</strong></h1>
    <p>Elhaym Alfscene</p>
    <h2>Metadata</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Audience: </strong>This essay is primarily for people familiar with, or interested in Japanese RPG video games
        who have not played the 1998 Squaresoft game Xenogears, but would like to learn more about it through an informal essay
        discussing a player's personal perspective on the game.

<body>
    <p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>
    <p>
        In 2011, I was at a low point. I had been kicked out of a pop punk band
        (no, I'll never shut up about this) after having already severed ties with some of my
        only and closest friends earlier the same year, around the same time I graduated from
        high school. That all, of course, is a story for another time. However, it's quite
        pertinent in one regard: with few close friends and obligations left, I had extra time on
        my hands. That is, especially in the jobless summers I enjoyed in those early college years.
        With my desire to create music at perhaps its lowest point, I turned elsewhere for
        stimulation. I unearthed my PlayStation 2 sometime in 2011-2012. I craved the experience
        of sitting on a couch for hours at a time, worrying about nothing and no one except the
        colorful characters on a screen in front of me. They would be my new friends.
    </p>
    <p>
        I investigated my existing library of PS2 games, but more than anything I wanted to
        see what else the console had to offer. I did some cursory Googling to try to discover
        what games people ranked highly. There was no shortage of lists for me to scour. Of
        course, on every list, in every comment section, there were mentions of character
        (caricature?)-driven post-platformers like Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank (I
        had been quite a fan of the latter's first game) as well as the big name RPG mainstays
        like Final Fantasy X. However, one title in particular kept coming up at a surprising
        rate: Xenosaga and its sequels. In retrospect, I'm still surprised at the regularity
        the title showed up among fans' "best PS2 games" lists due to its obvious niche appeal.
        I had never heard of the game before. Intrigued, I hesitantly ordered a copy of Xenosaga
        Episode I: Der Wille Zur Macht on Amazon for something like $15.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fast-forwarding to the spring of 2015: I had beaten all mainline Metal Gear Solid
        games as well as the Xenosaga trilogy (those are two separate topics deserving of essays
        in their own right). Xenosaga III's ending had a sickeningly profound effect upon me.
        Merely picturing it in my mind brought tears to my eyes, something that no other experience
        had ever managed to do to me. The pure drama and catharsis released in those final
        45-something minutes was unreal, and had been built upon three whole games' mythos.
        In an attempt to ride this high of wild emotion and sentimentality compounded upon by
        a philosophical underpinning, I went and bought Xenogears at the "full price" of $10 on PSN.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had always been aware of Xenogears as Xenosaga writer and director Tetsuya Takahashi's
        debut, and thematic progenitor. How applicable to my interest in Xenosaga it would prove
        to be, I did not know. I eventually made room for it in my game-playing schedule and
        jumped into my play-through relatively blind. I was initially wary, as my real comfort
        zone lie in the still-primitive but ultimately relatively elegant designs portrayed on
        the PS2. The PS1's library had been (and still remains) quite hit-or-miss for me - the
        gameplay and graphical limitations of many titles were a barrier to enjoyment, where the
        game design conventions defined by the PS2 era came to me more intuitively (It's my theory
        that the console generation we grow up with influences our taste in games the most - again,
        another topic for another time). Thankfully, Xenogears' status as a PS1 game did not
        at all stop me from getting irrevocably hooked after roughly the first hour of gameplay.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>The Hook</strong></h2>
    <p>
        In the first hour or so of Xenogears, we're introduced nicely to the protagonist Fei
        and his home village of three years, Lahan. He has no memory of his past since being
        brought there by a mysterious man. He's known as a talented painter, and to quote the
        satirical portrayal of Fei on whatdoesgodneedwithastarship.com, "[I'm] like a nine dan
        in a martial art that no one else in this town seems remotely familiar with." There's an
        implied love triangle, an impending marriage, and the wise, mysterious, yet down-to-Earth
        village doctor Citan. There's even a cameo by Lucca from Chrono Trigger! You get the idea
        that Lahan might be an important place, or at least Fei's "Pallet Town". What I love is
        that enough effort goes into describing the citizens and general feeling of Lahan to get
        the player invested and hooked before any action has taken place. It makes it all the more
        impactful when your expectations are quickly dashed later on. Almost needless to say,
        Shit Goes Down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shit goes down in such a way that following a short but very gripping bout of action,
        you're likely filled with a plethora of questions. The great thing about Xenogears, to
        me, is that they never go away. Questions get answered over the course of the story as
        the narrative careens this way and that, but they're promptly replaced by different, often
        more intense mysteries to ponder. Similarly, the course our heroes take near the beginning
        of the game is more of a wild adventure, getting swept up in other people's fights and
        meeting all sorts of varied characters. These fateful meetings seem to parallel the
        acquaintances we make in life as we strike out wildly on adventures of our own. Of course,
        this being a video game, the events are all heightened to an absurd degree and many of the
        characters distinct and important in the Xenogears world. As the game progresses, the
        events, locations and characters convene more upon the main themes and questions presented
        by the story - it gives a sense of the protagonist(s) gradually approaching the ultimate
        truth they seek.
    </p>
    <h2>Script? It's Just Written On Napkins</h2>
    <p>
        Speaking of the "ultimate truth" the characters seek, the events and themes of the game
        - this is the real heart of any discussion about Xenogears. Since this essay is meant
        to be spoiler-free, it's also the aspect most difficult to write about. But before I
        go any further, I'll attempt to convey the breadth of them with some accuracy.

    </ul>
    <p>
        I can't imagine what the actual working script of this game looks like. Every day
        I thank not-God for Richard Honeywood's work as the sole English translator on this
        gargantuan localization project. As I mentioned, I had just played through the Metal Gear
        Solid series, so I was thoroughly wary of idolizing another "visionary game director"
        unconditionally, given the highly controversial nature of Hideo Kojima and the amount of
        pure denial I experienced as one of his fans. So, the closest I ever got to idolizing Tetsuya
        Takahashi and Soraya Saga was wondering sincerely how fast their brains worked away at
        such grand concepts, distilling them into a story that could be contained in a 50-60
        hour RPG. Takahashi in particular, as he was the main writer, intrigued me. It seemed
        that even among his peers, he had a sort of indomitable and ever-persistent will to tell a very
        specific and elaborate story. This was made clear to me especially after having played the hyper-ambitious
        Xenosaga trilogy, which he founded an entire development company to create.
    </p>
    <p>
        Somewhat fittingly, the stories he writes are almost always centered around the central
        theme of the indomitable will he feels humanity possesses at large. That is, a metaphysical
        will so great it can cause great physical change in our plane of reality. It can absolutely
        be examined and criticized on multiple levels, notably an interpretation of Nietszche's "Will To Power"
        (after which the first Xenosaga was named). I don't think even he believes in such a concept's
        real-world manifestation. Rather, the "magical" things that happen in his games are merely
        a convenient but often beautiful and moving way to convey his larger belief in the concept
        of the human will and its strength and persistence. Keeping this in mind, with grand concepts
        come grand scripts.
    </p>
    <p>
        That said...did Takahashi accomplish his goal? Did he appear to tell every detail
        of the massive story he concocted in his head? Well, no. When you get to discussing
        creators like Takahashi, Kojima and Taro[1], they rarely capture the entirety of their
        vision in the final product. After all, when it comes down to it, a game is a software
        development project. ...And an art project. And a music album. And a script.
    </p>
    <h2>How True the Testament</h2>
    <p>
        Personally, I would argue that Takahashi's vision was most clearly realized either in
        Xenogears, Xenosaga III, or Xenoblade Chronicles. That comes with heavy qualifications
        of course. Firstly, Xenogears was left limping through its infamous second disc, which has
        many of the main story events being narrated by the protagonists, as well as entire subplots
        being born and killed off shortly thereafter. It's quite clear that there were meant to be
        more interweaving storylines, but they couldn't make the final cut. In a way, this makes
        the game even more impressive, considering it was cut down due to a 2-year project
        deadline[2]. The sheer length of the story that did make the cut is what makes me wonder
        if it was the most "realized" of the games.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondly, Xenosaga III was an absolute home run of a finale to a series that had gone
        through many changes. In actuality, it was somewhat of a huge band-aid for the wound that
        the previous two games caused. The first game covered much less material than intended,
        and the second was a complete shift in direction as Takahashi was relieved of his
        directorial role for the final two games. Ironically enough, III was meant to finish the
        series off as faithfully as it could be, partially as a way to honor Takahashi's vision.
        Analyzed alone, III is a great game. But of course, it can never be analyzed alone, as
        it stands on the shaky foundations of two less-than-stellar previous games.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thirdly, the more time that passes, the more I believe Xenoblade Chronicles might be
        the game of the seasoned director that adheres closest to its script and outline. That
        is, of course, at a cost. Takahashi took a noticeable shift in his approach to game
        design, which has been described quite accurately as a play to engage a younger audience.
        I would argue this included a greater scaling-down of the game project's scope from
        previous Xeno games, making it easier to fulfill the original vision. There's more
        action, less mystery, and the ultimate poetic message-slash-twist he delivers to us
        comes in the form of what is essentially a long speech at the end of the game. I
        have to admit, I was fuming a bit at said exposition. "You're cleverer than this,
        you bastard!" is what I wanted to shout. It was made more frustrating by the fact
        the end payoff doesn't say anything too much different from what he preached in previous
        games, much more artfully at that. What I wouldn't understand and come to appreciate
        until much later is that Xenoblade Chronicles is a completely different game for a
        completely different audience.
    </p>
    <p>
        I guess what this really says is that any of the three mentioned games can be
        considered Takahashi's "most realized" work, standing on very different merits.
        In speaking of scope and grandeur, it's worth noting that, when I and so many
        others finished Xenogears, a surprise appeared at the end of the credits. The screen
        remains black, and a final title card reads:
    </p>
    <p><strong>
    <center><p>XENOGEARS</p></center>
    <center><p>Episode V</p></center>
    <center><p>THE END</p></center>
    </strong></p>
    <p>
        Jesus Christ. This horribly overwrought, highly ambitious, messy 60+ hour game that could
        barely contain <i>itself</i> was meant to be Episode <i>five</i> of what I'd later learn was a six
        episode series. If that doesn't speak to the scale of the project, I don't know what does.
    </p>
    <h2>"Mitsuda the God"</h2>
    <p>
        I can't hope to discuss the merits of Xenogears without mentioning Yasunori Mitsuda,
        the game's composer. "Mitsuda, the God" - a common refrain between my friend and I.
        By now, he is among Japanese game composer royalty, but he worked hard in the 90s to
        prove himself and nowhere is that more apparent than the soundtrack of Xenogears.
        I have to say, it is very probably my favorite soundtrack album ever.
    </p>
    <p>
        The soundtracks of the late 90s in general tended towards halfway-realistic sounding
        soundfonts courtesy of sample packs and the still-evolving synths, workstation keyboards,
        and all manner of "ROMpler"s in the hands of composers. What this means is that Mitsuda
        was dealing with instruments that were quite obviously sampled and sequenced, sometimes at
        a noticeably low bit-rate. e.g., a facade of an orchestra, rather than a real one.
        Typically, this means that even beloved soundtracks can
        potentially age poorly due to the primitive nature of each individual sample. Despite
        this, the composition in Xenogears is jaw-dropping. Tracks drip with ominous dread
        (Omen), lighthearted excitement (Wings), and sorrowful beauty (Lost...Broken Shards).
        Even the slowest and most minimalist tracks march on in their own way, like a song
        accompanying a marionette that requires a rhythmic framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regarding Mitsuda's style, it's very interesting to compare the soundtrack of
        Xenogears with Xenosaga Episode I, which he also composed, although this time with
        a live orchestra. At first, I was taken aback by how different and "mainstream" the
        Xenosaga soundtrack seemed to sound. Over time, however, the commonalities and motifs
        present between all of Mitsuda's works begin to shine through. One of his giveaways
        can be found in the high-octave string parts he writes. They sound cold, brittle and
        thin no matter if sampled or played live. In contrast, I always compare this against
        Yuki Kajiura's string arrangements, which are present on the second two Xenosaga games.
        She has very lush, warm sounding strings, that are usually in a lower octave. While
        he uses the harp seemingly more sparingly than Kajiura, it is used to great effect, for
        the most emotional of motifs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of individual melodies, I may prefer other composers like Kajiura or
        Masashi Hamauzu (FFXIII, FFX), but in terms of sheer well-roundedness, it's hard not to favor
        Mitsuda almost every time. There's a reason he has been the sole or primary composer on
        such pivotal game projects.
    </p>
    <h2>Tanaka of the Clean Lines</h2>
    <p>
        Just as overlooking Mitsuda's contribution to Xenogears, so too would it be felonious
        to exclude Kunihiko Tanaka, the primary concept and character artist on the project. In
        truth, I don't know how extensive his contribution is in full. Most importantly, he
        designed the characters and mechs, which are some of the most beautiful aspects of the
        game. His style is unmistakable. His designs and illustrations are at the very
        forefront of anyone's mental image of Xenogears.
        <!--TODO: insert "portrait of Sophia"-->

    </p>
    <p><center><img src="Sophia.png"></center></p>
    <p>
        Known for tawny hair, bright colors, and highly distinctive costume design, his designs fit well
        with the game. In all honesty, I couldn't help but wonder if darker and slightly more realistic
        designs would fit even better, but there's an advantage to his more accessible designs.
        In truth, it wouldn't be a stretch to compare them to designs from a typical anime or
        even Saturday morning cartoon, prior to some necessary simplification for ease of
        animation. These vivid, colorful designs served to welcome game fans of all stripes into
        this arduous but rewarding journey of a game, for better or worse.
        <!--TODO: insert FMV screenshot of Fei and Elly-->
    </p>
    <p><center><img src="xenogears.jpg"></center></p>
    <p>
        While even the low-res in-game portraits are attractive, it's that much greater of an
        experience to take in his sketches and concept art for the game. Unburdened by the need
        for inking and coloring, his sketches flow with beautiful motion and emotion.
    </p>
    <p><center><img src="elly-sketch06.jpg"></center></p>
    <p>
        In this way, they become more than "anime" or "manga" and serve further to express the
        artist's individual style than to signify any greater dominant trend. Because of this,
        I'd argue that his work on Xenogears is easily more timeless than many RPGs of the time,
        though in terms of art direction, so many titles and companies were at the absolute
        top of their game, giving it ample competition.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        I realize much of this serves to act only as my gushing appraisal of Xenogears being
        the greatest work of our time, but even I am not blind to reality. There are many,
        many legitimate criticisms of the game on every possible level: Its gameplay is obtuse
        and highly frustrating at times. Takahashi's attempt to "do everything" in his first
        (and as it turns out, next) directorial project smothers the game under its own weight.
        Characters, while not always predictable, can still end up being evocative of RPG and
        general literary tropes and sometimes appear as Takahashi's mouthpiece or stand-in. Plot
        points can be seen as contrived and/or overly convenient. The list goes on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite all these well-placed criticisms, my final argument is and will likely always be
        this: It has been 20 years since Xenogears was released. No game has done what Xenogears
        has done, in the same style, with the same collection of influences, with the same
        mostly-seamless incorporation of so many disparate elements into one huge, dense game,
        before or since. By all means, if you've found any that approach the grand ideal
        Xenogears has put forth, let me know. It's practically my life mission at this point[3].
    </p>
    <p>
        My point remains that, while the more philosophically and sociologically literate of us
        will be able to point out all the ways Xenogears is "Philosophy 101" the same way, say,
        The Matrix is, it's somewhat moot. In the realm of <i>games</i>, which so frequently appeal to
        the lowest common denominator nowadays, Xenogears stood out among its peers even for the
        fertile development era of late-90's Japanese RPGs. That is, a genre known in itself for
        being ambitious and obtuse during the era when it was <i>most</i> so. Nowadays, whether big or
        small, a developer has a difficult time justifying the investment of money or time into
        a project as remotely huge as this, and understandably so. It was a risk to make - one
        that I and many others think, paid off. All these things combined ensure that I will always
        hold Xenogears near and dear to my heart.

        <li>I know these are the most "mainstream" of ambitious and "artsy" Japanese game
            developers, but they're the ones I'm most familiar with.

        <li>
            Yes, I am aware of many of the "runner-ups". At the time of writing, I'm about halfway
            through The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC and consider the series dear to my heart
            already. The Trails in the Sky series is probably the closest to Xenogears in its achievements
            on several merits, namely worldbuilding.

    <h2>Addendum:</h2>
    <p>This GameSpot video does a good job at explaining the appeal of Xenogears succinctly in spoiler-free video format.</p>

    <p>
        If you've made it this far and are still interested, I invite you to find a way to play Xenogears
        or even Xenosaga. They can be troublesome, difficult games. But if you can take the punishment they
        deal out for the reward of experiencing truly one-of-a-kind narratives and rhetorical techniques
        in the context of video games as a whole, at least give it a shot. That is my sales pitch.
