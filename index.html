	<h2><font color = "white">about this page</font></h2>
	<p>I'm a programmer by trade, but my real interests lie in anime, art, video games, making music, and firearms as well as many other areas.</p>
	
	<p>I have wanted to create a "personal website" for a long time. 
		Part of this was an admiration for "web 1.0" styled "homepage culture". 
		Part of this was a great excuse to hone my HTML/web development skillz.
		Part of this was a simple disillusionment with "web 2.0" ideas of social media 
		and everyone having identical homepages on sites like facebook.
		Despite this, at the time of writing, I still participate in most of the 
		common social media sites. But this page is to act as my one "true"
		homepage, that describes me better than any other page could.
