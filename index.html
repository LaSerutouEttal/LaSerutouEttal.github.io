	<h2><font color = "white">About This Page</font></h2>
	<p>I'm a computer science major who makes music. Some of my interests revolve around
		anime, video games and art. </p>
	
	<p>I have wanted to create a "personal website" for a long time. 
		Part of this was an admiration for "web 1.0" styled "homepage culture". 
		Part of this was a great excuse to hone my HTML/web development skillz.
		Part of this was a simple disillusionment with "web 2.0" ideas of social media 
		and everyone having identical homepages on sites like facebook.
		Despite this, at the time of writing, I still participate in most of the 
		common social media sites. But this page is to act as my one "true"
		homepage, that describes me better than any other page could. 
		Hopefully I can build it up into something cool. </p>
