    <h2>Metadata</h2>
    <p><strong>Audience: </strong>This is an essay for those who have played Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 2
        (or do not mind spoilers for these games) who wish to read a brief surface-level academic essay discussing the
        rhetorical techniques utilized by the pivotal video game work Metal Gear Solid 2 as well as their impact.
        To be honest, I wished to write more extensively on this game, but I didn't spend as much time
        as I would have liked due to other courses demanding my attention at the time.
        This was originally written in 2015 as part of an English class taught by professor and video game writer /

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>The usage of misinformation within and the metanarrative of Hideo Kojima’s <i>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</i>
        (MGS2) continues to be effective even today. The game features a convoluted story that demands players "buy
        into" it in order to progress, but the official story given to the players continually changes over the course
        of the game. The player is challenged to believe increasingly bizarre "truths" until the true nature of the
        story is revealed at the end.

    <h2>SUMMARY OF METAL GEAR SOLID 2: PLOT POINTS</h2>
    <p>
        In order to begin to understand MGS2, one must be familiar with its prequel, <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> (MGS). In MGS, we
        play as Solid Snake, a supersoldier in every regard. Snake is given a mission to take down the latest
        incarnation of his former special forces unit, FOXHOUND. The unit is demanding a ransom be met; otherwise,
        they’ll use the bipedal tank named Metal Gear REX to launch a nuke on an unsuspecting country, triggering
        nuclear war. The game plays out almost like a comic book, with each member of FOXHOUND being extraordinary
        soldiers who all end up facing off (and losing) against Snake throughout the game. At the end, Snake must
        defeat Metal Gear REX itself, a gigantic mech many times Snake’s size.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite its exaggerated delivery, the game touched on real-world issues and the sentiments of its players.
        When Snake meets Hal Emmerich, the chief engineer of Metal Gear, a monologue ensues where Emmerich laments
        the discovery that he’s continued the proliferation of nuclear weapons throughout the world. In this segment,
        real-world statistics and footage are delivered in a montage format, barraging the player with information and
        communicating an agenda within a limited timespan. This can be seen as an early example of a direct line of
        communication between Hideo Kojima and the player, RE: Kojima’s personal philosophy. These instances of vivid
        monologue are unmistakable, and can be picked out even more clearly in MGS2.
    </p>
    <p>
        MGS2 is the combined story of Solid Snake and a new character, Raiden. MGS2 is, somewhat infamously, divided
        into two chapters. The first chapter takes place in 2007, two years after <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, and finds Solid
        Snake and companion Hal Emmerich collaborating as an NGO dedicated to wiping out "bootleg" Metal Gears across
        the world. Snake infiltrates a U.S. Marines tanker ship and obtains photographic evidence of a proprietary
        U.S. Marines Metal Gear prototype. Russian soldiers under the command of former FOXHOUND member Revolver
        Ocelot take over the tanker, steal the new Metal Gear, and sink the ship in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second chapter takes place two years after the first, in 2009. The sinking of the tanker in 2007
        was used as an excuse to build the "Big Shell", an offshore oil cleanup facility. Special operative
        Raiden (real name: Jack) is sent to infiltrate the Big Shell when a group of terrorists take the president
        hostage and demand a ransom lest they launch a nuke (note that this plot is intentionally almost identical
        to that of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>). Over the course of his mission on the Big Shell, the official objective changes
        many times as Raiden begins to learn classified information.
    </p>
    <p>
        After many lies and instances of misdirection from outside actors, the final truth is revealed:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Big Shell <i>itself</i> is the new Metal Gear, a structure that houses an AI to manage the digital
            flow of information everywhere.
        </li>
        <li>
            Raiden’s commanding officer, a radio contact, is a construct of this AI.
        </li>
        <li>
            Raiden’s entire mission is guided by this AI, which was created by an organization named the "Patriots".
        </li>
        <li>
            The western world is run by a shadow government named the "Patriots",
            who exert control over all aspects of life.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the mission is completed, the AI will have proven itself capable of managing
            intensive amounts of information (data generated by Raiden’s actions during his mission)
            and will be deployed to manage (censor) the flow of digital information in the real world. This
            information management comes as a natural extension of the Patriots’ wide reach.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>INTENDED AUDIENCE OF MGS2</h2>
    <p>
        The intended audience of MGS2 is, without a doubt, existing fans who have previously played <i>Metal Gear
        Solid.</i> This is supported by several facts within and surrounding the game. The game’s launch was hotly
        anticipated (IGN). On top of this, the ad campaign leading up to the game’s launch was purposefully
        misleading, purporting the idea that players would once again step into the shoes of Solid Snake for the
        duration of the game. Wolfe describes it as such: "Without exaggeration, it is probably the most devastating
        ‘twist’ to ever happen to the videogame world, and the total lack of preparation was a key factor." This
        would have dubious relevance to the question of who the game was intended for, except for one colossal
        realization: Raiden <i>is</i> the player.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the course of the game, the fact that Raiden has only experienced VR (Virtual Reality) training is
        heavily emphasized. Raiden idolizes Solid Snake, asking him when they finally meet, "...are you <i>the</i> Snake?"
        incredulously. Raiden even mentions how he ran through a simulation of the events of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>
        at one point. Furthermore, if the player beats the "Tanker" chapter prior to playing the "Big Shell" chapter,
        Raiden will mention he experienced a VR mission of those events, as well. The player is even asked to input
        their personal information, which appears on dogtags Raiden is seen donning at the end of the game. The
        parallels go on and on, but suffice it to say that it’s been conclusively shown that Raiden is not only the
        player’s avatar, but an in-game representation of the player themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Raiden-as-player axiom is interesting, but would be nothing without the overall feeling the
        game is meant to impress upon the player. Since we are (presumably) so coupled with Raiden, the
        bizarre trajectory the game follows affects us on an even deeper level. At the very least, Raiden is
        made to react to the story’s twists in much the same way we would, playing the game.
    </p>
    <h2>RHETORICAL THEORY USED</h2>
    <p>
        The framework I’ll be using are the three appeals of Aristotle. These consist of Ethos, Logos and Pathos:
        credibility of the presenter, a logical appeal or informative piece, and an emotional connection. Instead
        of centering these appeals around myself, it would be more relevant to focus them on the game itself. MGS2
        commands attention, and the focus of this essay isn’t about my expertise in the area, but rather the game’s
        effects on a player.
    </p>
    <h2>RHETORICAL THEORY APPLIED</h2>
    <p>LOGOS: <i>It (mis)informs</i></p>
    <p>
        As I mentioned earlier, MGS2’s launch was not only hotly anticipated, but accompanied by an information
        campaign from Konami that promised fans everything they sought in a sequel. This was the first
        dissemination of misinformation from the authorities on MGS2 (Kojima, Konami) and it would continue
        through the gameplay. The "authority" seen in the game is not Konami, but rather the faceless Patriots,
        who lead Raiden’s actions almost exactly as if guiding a rat through a maze. They do this through verbal
        communication; This game’s "Colonel Campbell" is an artificial intelligence construct that does the official
        job of "informing" Raiden, verbally doing whatever is necessary to get him to complete the mission.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is effective throughout most of the game, because like Raiden, even when we disagree with the
        Colonel’s orders we follow them. We cannot progress unless we do, but also because of the higher concept
        of Campbell being our direct superior; a figure of uncontested authority as presented by the game.
    </p>
    <p>ETHOS: <i>It creates emotional attachment</i></p>
    <p>
        There are several avenues through which MGS2 attempts to appeal to the emotions of players.
        The idolatry of Solid Snake, a now humble warrior-poet; the fragile (and, as we learn, manufactured)
        relationship between Rose and Jack; Raiden’s secret past as a child soldier; And, perhaps most cinematic,
        the reunion of estranged siblings Hal and Emma Emmerich, and the latter’s tragic death. It’s truly a game
        filled with tragedy and dark revelations; ones that ramp up in intensity as we progress further into it.
    </p>
    <p>PATHOS: <i>It was created by Kojima.</i></p>
    <p>
        Hideo Kojima is a Japanese game designer who has spent the overwhelming majority of his career working
        at Konami Corporation. He’s produced an unprecedented number of games in a single "Metal Gear" universe,
        as well as spin-offs and other franchises. Since <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i>, he’s displayed similar mastery of
        narrative in the <i>Solid</i> series’ 3rd and 4th entries, the latter having well over 8 hours of cinematic cutscenes
        presenting its narrative. Not only is he known for strong metafiction tying his games together, his strong
        attention to detail and unique game mechanics have been praised repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Above all else, Kojima has been known to plan out his games in relentless detail and include not
        only layers of meaning, but many easter eggs as well (Weidman). As much as he places emphasis on
        the spoken word, he invests equally in gameplay that will make the player feel a certain way, and
        think about what is happening in the game world. He’s been known to purport that games themselves
        aren’t art, but rather the space between the player and the game is (Wolfe). In other words, the
        real-time emotions a player experiences when playing.
    </p>
    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
    <p>
        <center><i>"Life isn't just about passing on your genes. We can leave behind much more than just DNA.
        Through speech, music, literature and movies...what we've seen, heard, felt...anger, joy and sorrow...
        these are the things I will pass on. That's what I live for. We need to pass the torch, and let our
        children read our messy and sad history by its light."</i>
        -Solid Snake, <i>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</i></center>
    </p>
    <p>
        What really matters to my exploration and research of MGS2 is whether it achieved its goals. Due to
        the convoluted nature of the game, it’s been hotly debated what <i>Sons of Liberty</i>’s goals even were.
        However, I will make a conservative assumption based on the facts as they are presented in the game.
        That is, in accordance with the time-tested concept known as Occam’s Razor: the hypothesis with the
        fewest assumptions should always be selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        In short, we are made to feel vulnerable after having the mission objective change so rapidly and often,
        that we accept Solid Snake’s (Kojima’s) ending monologue as a life preserver of truth in a sea of lies.
        This is my assumption of the base meaning of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many game details can be re-interpreted and examined after the fact, but it’s no mistake that
        Kojima’s speech about memes and the human condition was placed at the end and delivered the way
        it was. At this point in the game, it’s likely that the player has been playing for several hours,
        given the frustrating yet driving tasks of destroying 20 Metal Gears and facing off against Solidus
        Snake in a swordfight on top of Federal Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
        After Raiden’s fight is done, everything slows down. Literally, the passerby are walking in slow motion as
        Raiden is addressed by the magically-appearing Solid Snake on the streets of New York. Like <i>Metal Gear
        Solid</i>’s montage, Snake’s words about passing on meaning through generations is set to a backdrop of real-life
        sepia tone footage of daily life in the city. It’s not only peaceful, it’s calming. All we, the player,
        want to do at this point is hear something that makes sense.
    </p>
    <p>
        That is, a "truth" that is actually consistent with <i>itself</i>, as opposed to the lies we accepted and then
        were forced to reject during our mission. Hideo Kojima knew he had an important message, but one that
        was also highly relatable given the right presentation. He emphasizes a nonpolitical approach, one that
        emphasizes our humanity. It contrasts heavily against the alien, mechanized "Big Brother"-esque Patriot
        ideology we were exposed to so much over the previous few hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, what has been the overall sentiment regarding <i>Sons of Liberty</i> since its release? There are
        two dominant feelings that seem to run parallel to each other in Metal Gear discussions; confusion and
        pride. Many fans are still completely confused by the twists and turns MGS2 presents, unable to make
        sense of the details presented to them. Few others have constructed deep and sound theories that tie
        the game together with itself, presenting a complete picture of what really happened.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondary and most times independent to this, of course, is a feeling of pride. Fans often praise the
        work as being ahead of its time, and one of the reasons they continue to follow Kojima’s works; the simple
        explanation of this cognitive dissonance being, <i>"I didn’t understand what I saw, but I was deeply moved by
        it."</i> In this way, I think the game has accomplished what it set out to do. Perhaps we weren’t meant to make
        sense of all the little details (though some, like Wolfe, have done a commendable job in doing so) but
        instead bask in MGS2’s final meaning about language, memes and the state of humanity in the digital age.
