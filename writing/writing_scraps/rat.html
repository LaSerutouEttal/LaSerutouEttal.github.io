    <h1>Rat & Yank</h1>
</head>
<body>
    <p>"I... think we’ve decided to move on without you. As a band."</p>

    <p>The words that Rat dreaded most were now said, floating before him in the air. The words hovered in the space
        between him and Yank for a beat. Then, steeling himself with a frown, Rat turned away with as deliberate a
        motion he could muster. Yank started, and stopped when he realized his words would have no effect. "Rat, come on…"
    </p>
    <p>
        I just have to grab my guitar, Rat thought. The amp’s borrowed, so I don’t need to take that with me. Only
        thing that belongs to me in this building is the guitar. Rat grabbed his guitar and in one motion threw the
        strap over his shoulder. He clutched the neck with a desperate grip. Moving around now was an exercise in
        control. To keep from shaking, it required all of Rat’s concentration. As a result, he felt as if he was
        levitating out of shock by the time he turned towards Yank.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even this situation didn’t come as a total surprise to the guitarist. He had some rough outline of what he’d
        like to say stored in his memory from the brief spells he spent considering the possibility of being kicked
        out of his band.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yank knew better than to challenge Rat right now. It was best to let him unleash whatever part of him he
        had stored up inside for all this time and wipe the rant-manufactured spittle from his face afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Look at this guitar." Yank looked down even as Rat held the instrument up, for they were now so close to one
        another that their positioning necessitated it. Rat’s voice was more nervous - yet driven - than Yank
        had seemingly ever heard it. "It’s one of my favorite guitars. In fact, it’s my first."
    </p>
    <p>
        "My dad bought me this guitar, back when I was fifteen. I begged him for it. For anything I could get my
        hands on that’d let me play a chord. He did it right, man. He saved and bought me a nice guitar. One that’d
        last me. Even before I knew anything about anything, I stayed up each night feeling of it, trying to
        practice and get my head around the thing. I didn’t know shit except what was in front of me. I practiced
        and got good. I gave my life to this instrument, and you damn well know that."
    </p>
    <p>
        Yank considered his words, but stuck on the number "fifteen"...remembering the two had first met at
        seventeen. Those tender years came flooding back, fueled by Rat’s passion. "I met you, and the
        girls, and…" Rat’s voice began to crack. Tears were flowing. "Rat…" A push back. "No! Don’t fucking
        touch me!" there was now more space between the two. "Once I knew what I was doing, I knew all I
        wanted was this band. My fucking heart, man. My fucking soul. And now you take it away from me! You’re
        always taking, when all I wanna do is give. You fucking fraud!"
    </p>
    <p>
        It was at the height of Rat’s melodrama that Yank recalled the bottle on top of an amplifier from which Rat
        had been swigging all night. Yank knew him well enough to decode his language when the alcohol kicked in.
        Yank wasn’t a "fraud" in the dictionary sense, of course, but it was a term that Rat felt apt for one reason
        or another. Rat’s voice shrank again before a crescendo back to his signature yell. "What the fuck are you
        thinking? You fucking cunt! You really think you can just do this to someone like that? Well, I’ll show you."
        The nervousness was kicking in, and Rat’s speech became more quaint and deliberately phrased. There was no
        language floating through Rat’s mind any more. Nothing resembling words or letters, but rather colors and
        emotion. Adrenaline surged, and he knew only one thing: to destroy. But, all at once, he wanted the
        destruction not to be aimless.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes, that was it. That’d do just fine.
    </p>
    <p>
        As if playing on Woodstock’s stage, or a basement in 1989 Seattle, or a bar in 1970s London, he raised
        his favorite guitar over his head and attacked the floor with sickening speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, the guitar’s muted cream colored body separated from the neck, and some strings from the
        bridge. One chunk of wood and its associated splinters seceded from the body as well, and slid some
        feet across the floor. The metallic "clang" of his first guitar’s demise was underwhelming. It did
        not reverberate, it did not create a cacophony. It did nothing but create the least amount of noise
        it possibly could. Rat knew this from some universal axiom he had probably learned once in a physics
        class. He did not care. Almost in the same motion that heralded the guitar’s demise, Rat crumpled to
        his knees letting out a pathetic wail, almost compensating for how quiet the crash of the guitar had
        proved to be. As Yank moved in towards him, Rat scrambled upwards and skittered across the floor,
        gathering up the guitar’s body and the errant chunk of wood before leaving through the door and running
        down the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even Yank now had a tear in his eye. "Jesus Christ." He covered his mouth, looking at the mostly-closed
        door as if he expected Rat to come back through it. He wouldn’t, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
        He’d never come back through that door again.

        This was a short one-off piece of writing I did recently. I often imagine scenes of great catharsis based on
        events real and imagined. This is kind of a melodramatic amalgamation of the two. I still think of the difficult
        times I experienced playing music with others in bands often (whether it was made difficult by my behavior or
        others...).
