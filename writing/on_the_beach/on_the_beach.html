        I wrote this earlier this month when I was on vacation in the Seattle area. It was the first big vacation I'd
        had completely planned by myself, and also the first where I traveled completely alone. I received some very
        helpful writing/editing/revising advice from <a href="https://twitter.com/plasticbagger">@plasticbagger</a>
        on twitter. Thanks for reading.

    <h1>On the Beach</h1>
    <p>
        Today I made it to the farthest point on my road trip out to Washington. The centerpiece to my trip was
        always intended to be visiting a beach on the Pacific coast. I’m staying in Forks, WA and today I visited
        Second Beach and Rialto Beach.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I drove out to Second Beach, I started on the trail out to the sea. After a little while of walking
        and occasionally taking pictures with my fancy new camera, I realized both the battery packs I had on me
        were depleted. I began quietly cursing myself over this mistake, but decided to continue on to the beach
        anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was the same beach I had visited with my family over a decade ago, and the primary reason I decided
        to come out to Washington on vacation. Every family road trip I’ve gone on has been packaged with a
        particularly undesirable compromise. Every trip itinerary was at the mercy of my mother and father,
        with only a bit of planning relinquished to my brother and I as the years went on. Usually what this meant
        in practice was that we did a lot of camping and moving from place to place, trying to maximize the number
        of destinations visited in our time on the road. As such, I never really felt like I truly got a taste of
        any one location I visited.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Washington, however, there was something that resonated deeply with me about the long, deep beach
        that was peppered with huge rock formations, the backs of which host coniferous trees of their own. It
        was clear that some time long in the past, these huge cliffs split off from the mainland for one reason
        or another, but haven’t yet moved fully out to sea, if indeed they ever will continue their migration. The
        tides roll in slowly and thinly, and often you’ll look off into the distance and see farther reaches of the
        beach cliffs flanked with fog. When I had first visited, it was a beautiful, clear day conducive for
        exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, it was overcast and chilly, but not oppressive. This was all I really cared about. While I
        half-heartedly prepared for a sunny day by bringing swim trunks and a beach towel, I didn’t expect one.
        If the power of this beach could truly reach me, it would do so regardless of the weather. I emerged onto
        the beach and recalled that, somewhat strangely, the path to the actual beach was completely blocked by huge
        interwoven piles of petrified logs. This obstacle completely betrayed the rather easy trail leading up to it
        that I even saw traversed by some older folks. I carefully climbed over the dead trees and landed with a thump
        on the soft sand of the beach. There were several other groups of people there, each exploring at their own
        pace.

        I walked out to the surf and saw the waves terminate, looking like the foam at the top of a fresh beer.
        I knelt down and felt the malleable wet sand in my hand. I chucked it back in the surf and rinsed my
        hands with the bone-chillingly cold water. I continued like this down the beach, pausing every so often
        to take photos with my phone.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I walked, I felt more and more free from my physical trappings. I thought only of my present surroundings
        and, like the waves, how I had completed some kind of unspoken cycle by returning to this beach. I kept
        coming across the remains of crabs in every state of decomposition. I first saw a complete bleached crab
        skeleton, then “fresher” individual pieces, and finally one that looked like it could have been alive but was
        likely only just recently deceased. I lamented the fact I couldn’t have been surprised by a living one,
        skittering around on the beach. Strangely though, this only contributed to the pervasive feeling of loneliness
        that had been growing inside me during my walk. Of course, I was joined by half a dozen handfuls of people
        spread across the massive beach, but my conscious mind seemed to dismiss them almost completely. This was,
        with a grim gladness, one of the public situations where I could have interacted with any number of people
        but was not obligated to in any way. Any situation like this was a relief for me, as someone whose
        introvertedness invariably dominates their daily life.

    <p>
        I finally stopped at a point that was farther out to sea than any other part of the surrounding beach.
        I watched the waves, now with no one between me and them. I thought about how if I were to begin swimming
        now, the first nation I’d reach would be Russia or Japan depending on my bearing. I had a preference for
        Japan, setting aside the physical impossibility of the daydream I indulged about swimming the Pacific.
        Several important (but still online only) friends had visited the country only very recently, sometimes
        multiple times. I wondered how this was possible. Planning this road trip alone within my own country was
        taxing enough on me. The idea of going someplace like Japan was like going to another planet as far as I was
        concerned. This later occupied a greater place in my mind along with a dose of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
        I thought about how this whole beach might be underwater in 20 years. In thinking this, I returned briefly
        to a train of thought I’d entertained a lot in recent days. In imagining the upcoming effects of climate
        change (or climate disaster), I wondered what the last “perfect day” would be. This was a concept that
        terrified and fascinated me. The general conceit of the idea is that, as Earth becomes less and less
        habitable by humans due to global warming, there will be fewer and fewer enjoyable days that fit the
        criteria of a “perfect day”, by an anthropocentric definition. A “perfect day”, meaning that the sun
        is out in a mostly clear sky, the winds are calm, and the temperature is warm but agreeable. The question
        of the timing of the last “perfect day” is really kind of a trick question, because one might occur again
        ages after humans are no longer here to see it. Or perhaps our distant ancestors will experience a
        beautiful day and not have the societal norms or even the same senses to tell them that a clear sky and
        warm air is something to enjoy and savor.

    <p>
        Returning to the more practical future I may live to see: I wondered if the cliffs before me would
        become the new beach, the old one having been drowned. The forest would be broken down by the crashing
        waves, creating driftwood, and the grass underneath would certainly be drowned by the surf, creating
        another frontier of sand. The surf would probably rise quickly enough that old roads existing underwater
        would become more and more common.
    </p>
    <p>
        My time on the beach was a cumulative experience, a certain feeling building up in me the whole time I
        was there. It was me, the strangers, the sea, and the minimal dialogue I had with myself. As I stared
        out at the restless grey waves emerging from an equally grey sky, I felt everything about me wither away.
        I didn’t feel weighed down by my clothes, the bags I was wearing, or even the fatigue my body had
        accumulated. I forgot about my job, the bills I had to pay, and the sometimes tumultuous path my life
        had taken and the important decisions I had made over the past year and 9 months. I had left friends,
        friends had changed, taken up new jobs and careers, people had moved. And like the beach, with its
        graveyard of dead trees, I lay decimated in the wake of all this change.
    </p>
    <p>
        I didn’t even stop to consider the cynical quandary of spending 50 weeks at work per year to experience
        these few all-too-fleeting moments of genuine, sober release. Though it is painfully true, I sully these
        pages with its very mention, for that’s not what I want to discuss right now.
    </p>
    <p>

        What I was mainly fleeing from was the mundane; the grinding shitty experiences that occur every day.
        The minor issues I have with my coworkers, how I present myself in public, my consistently mediocre
        appearance, and the absurdity of operating in public areas and situations while the world feels like it’s
        breaking apart. I was also escaping the fallout from the failures of personal relationships that had slowly
        deteriorated over almost the past 2 years. Here, on the beach, these problems were feeling farther and
        farther away by the second. These were all individual hells that each screamed at me to attend to them,
        but the beach had other plans. The beach became my cold yet nurturing ally, tearing my demons away from
        me by force. The time I spent here would not be defined by the things that killed me; only the things from
        within that kept me alive and upright here among the waves. I was finally able to be alone.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        I made the decision to go back to my car, find a way to recharge my camera batteries and phone, and visit
        at least one other beach. After that, I might return to Second Beach later when I could actually take photos.
        As I began my walk back the way I came, emotions swelled in me and tears met my eyes. I was considering
        the enormity of the waves, this location, and the fact I hadn’t spent even this much time alone in nature
        in ages. I retired to my motel temporarily to re-prepare, and once ready decided to head out to Rialto beach,
        which was similar to Second Beach but sans a trail.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had a similar experience on Rialto Beach, though extended in duration. My visit started out in rougher
        weather, as it had begun to rain. I couldn’t take many photos this way. I continued on down the beach,
        this time heading north. Eventually, things cleared up enough that I was only threatened with a minor
        drizzle, and then later not even that. As I walked, I became determined to reach a large outcropping
        flanked by several huge rock formations in the distance. I took many photos of my surroundings.

        My mind frantically grappled to find a video game I could compare this scenery to, and found nothing.
        This was for the best. I had already been mentally freed from feelings of self-consciousness in my
        experience watching the waves on Second Beach. I had no reference point, no connection to this scenery
        but my firsthand, real-time experience. I tore off my sunglasses in a desire to see everything
        with my own eyes, and it was like tearing off blinders. What appeared to be a bleak scene through dark and
        scuffed sunglasses was, in fact, an array of earthy shades and liquid shapes defined by the constant attack
        of waves over a period of eons. All the air I had breathed over the past day had been undeniably fresh,
        something I’d not usually remark upon except for the fact I had been standing at the literal edge of a
        nation, facing down waves that separated men for thousands of miles and for all of knowable history. I once
        again tried to grasp the monumental implications of this realization, predictably failing but gaining some
        approximation of understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
        I could have as easily been standing (again) at the edge of the Grand Canyon, surveying the humbling expanse
        before me. The scene also carried with it a sense of some kind of unknown finality. I didn’t dwell on it for
        too long, but held the feeling in my mind with a quiet respect for its power. A respect for what it could
        mean to me later, when I had the chance to interrogate it further - but still, I was more interested in
        banishing most thought in deference to physically experiencing my surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
        I thought about how easily I could have been sitting in front of a computer monitor right then, playing
        video games on a Friday night, largely unfulfilled and unconnected with my fellow humans. I also came to
        realize something else, quite startlingly in fact. It was that, as far as I can remember in recent memory,
        this had been the first time I’d gone several days without thinking about the idea of suicide.
