    <p>I wrote this in response to a writing prompt about what I considered to be the best gift I'd received.
    I forgot about this story until I wrote it out.

<h1>Gift</h1>
<p>
    One chilly day when I was in my mid-teens, I went with my brother to his college campus to go see a concert of a
    friend of his, who was majoring in guitar performance. Afterwards, we went to a book shop in Dinkytown (the name
    for the part of town adjacent to campus and frequented by U of M students). I was taken with the claustrophobic
    nature of the store, the dim lighting, and deep, musty smell of old books. The books were so numerous they seemed
    to make up the very structure of the building. It gave off the impression of a place containing potential treasures
    waiting to be found, if only you were willing to sort through them.
</p>
<p>
    A section near the register caught my eye much more readily, however. There were three deep racks of vinyl LPs,
    which my brother had been collecting for some years and I had followed suit not too long after he started. Looking
    through the racks, the overall number in stock was comparatively small in regard to dedicated record stores I
    usually frequent, but the content was exponentially more valuable. I saw record after record I wanted - needed -
    but couldn’t spare the cash for. I remember finding Construction Time Again by Depeche Mode, among countless other
    records I didn’t yet have and the sight of which made me salivate.
</p>
<p>
    Clearly though, after the dust of my frantic flipping through LPs had settled, one stood out. I found an original
    copy (including original lyric sheet!) of Melissa by Mercyful Fate, the debut LP of a Danish heavy metal band known
    for catapulting its morbid showman vocalist, King Diamond, to notoriety. I had only discovered Mercyful Fate a
    few years prior, but they quickly gained my favor to the point that they were easily considered my favorite band.
    Their unorthodox song structure, King Diamond’s theatrics and highly unusual voice, and their occult image called
    out to me like no other band could at the time. I consumed everything I could by them and was even a regular on a
    forum dedicated to their works.
</p>
<p>
    My excitement at finding this record was clearly palpable. I wouldn’t be surprised if my jaw dropped, and I know I
    struggled to keep my voice low in the quiet, almost empty bookstore as I proclaimed my triumph. There was a
    problem, though. The record was $14, and fourteen dollars I did not have. I stared at the record, trying to
    absorb as much of it as I could visually and in tactile feel before I inevitably had to put it back down and
    leave the store. I cursed my luck, having come here to this place that seemed hip and obscure to my teenage self,
    only having been with my brother. If my mom was there, I had a good enough rapport with her that I may have been
    able to convince her to buy it for me, even if it meant paying her back with my allowance at a later date…
</p>
<p>
    And then, something unexpected happened. As we were otherwise ready to leave, my brother took the record from
    my hands, looked it over, and paid for it. At first, I cynically wondered if he actually bought it for himself,
    either to torment me or because he realized the value of the record. But right then, he returned it to me after
    the transaction. The fact is, especially as a young college student, my brother was notoriously stingy with his
    money. My mother would borrow small amounts of cash from him every once in a while and he’d hound her about paying
    him back, despite her never having been unreliable about such things. With this fresh in my mind, it was
    unthinkable to me that he just ponied up fourteen whole dollars to buy me a record out of the blue when I was
    near-penniless one day!
</p>
<p>
    I don’t remember what words were exchanged at the time, but I must have thanked him at least. We never had
    anything of a remotely sentimental relationship, which further pushed this happening into uncharted territory.
    The closest we got was as my teenage years progressed, I’d spend more and more time hanging out in his room
    listening to his records while he either did college assignments or chatted with his then girlfriend on Yahoo!
    Messenger for hours on end. The surrounding circumstances make that my favorite “gift”. I have to wonder if he
    remembers even doing that for me, but I feel I won’t forget.
