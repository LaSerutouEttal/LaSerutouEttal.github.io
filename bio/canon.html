    <h2>video games</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="expand">Xenogears (1998, PS1)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>I believe that Xenogears and Xenosaga are artistic high points in the video game medium. Xenogears is known
            for helping define the renaissance that Japanese RPGs enjoyed in the late 90s. Unlike many games before
            or since, it combined many religious and psychological theories to create an extremely compelling narrative.

        <li class="expand">Half-Life (1998, PC)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Half-Life defined my childhood. More importantly, it completely defined and revolutionized the first-
                person-shooter genre and spawned a vibrant modding community.
                With a robust engine, expansive, expressive and meaningful level design, it's no
                stretch to say that first person shooter games are still learning lessons it put forth all the way back
                in 1998.

        <li class="expand">Final Fantasy X (2001, PS2)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Final Fantasy X was my first ever JRPG. That alone guarantees I can never be objective about judging it,
                however I think its popularity is well deserved. In my opinion it is the quintessential Final Fantasy -
                great worldbuilding, beautiful characters, gorgeous soundtrack. For those who played Final Fantasy X
                at an impressionable age, Spira stays with them for a long time. "People die, and Yuna dances."

        <li class="expand">Metal Gear Solid 2 (2001, PS2)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                I have a tattoo of the Big Shell on my left arm. Big whoop, right? I have many criticisms of this game
                and its creator, but that does not do anything to deny the massive impact it has had on me. It is the
                perfect post-modern mind explosion to immediately follow its prequel, Metal Gear Solid. Its predictions
                about the digital age continue to be relevant even at the time of writing this (2018).
            </p>
        </div>
        <li class="expand">The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (2004, PC)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Whenever I get burnt out on video games as a whole, I play a Trails game. Trails in the Sky is such a
                beautiful meditation on the JRPG genre. Released shortly after the late 90s RPG "renaissance", Falcom
                distilled the best qualities of said RPGs into one charming, streamlined, heat-wrenching experience. The
                localizations done in recent years by XSEED are nothing short of masterful. I recommend this game to people
                with an interest in "old school JRPGs" on a regular basis.
            </p>
        </div>
        <li class="expand">Final Fantasy XII (2006, PS2)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                If Final Fantasy X was my introduction to JRPGs, Final Fantasy XII brought it to a completely new level.
                It's difficult for me to describe how gorgeous this game is on every possible level. The environments are
                enrapturing. The characters almost take a backseat to them, but enjoy the same great writing and localization
                that is afforded for the game's worldbuilding and backstory. Sakimoto's soundtrack and Matsuno's scenario
                is exquisite. Everything is seemingly ornate and looked over several times. The whole game carries with it
                a strong sense of grandiose "high adventure" that I struggle to describe to others.
            </p>
        </div>
        <li class="expand">BioShock Infinite (2013, PC)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Bioshock Infinite was perhaps the first game I was ever obsessed with where I was aware of said obsession.
                After finishing the base game, but before the DLC came out, I filled a notebook page with my theory of
                Infinite's "timelines" in order to make sense of the tragic beauty of a game I had just played. Where
                Half-Life redefined the first person shooter, Bioshock Infinite re-defined it in an adventurous, narrative-
                focused way that didn't forget about the basic mechanics that made the genre so utterly satisfying.
            </p>
        </div>
        <li class="expand">Overwatch (2016, PC)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Overwatch is the first online game I have regularly stuck with since release, pouring well over a hundred
                hours into it as of early 2018. An estranged college friend introduced me to it by showing me its first
                cinematic trailer before it had been released. I was expecting something unexciting, but the trailer had
                reinvigorated me in the tradition of the online FPS once again. At first exposure, I was quite
                interested by Widowmaker, Genji, and D.Va. This game is somewhat of a masterclass in character
                and UI design, as well as how to keep things performant and fresh after a long, long time playing.

    <h2>movies</h2>
        <li class="expand">Bloodsport (1988)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Bloodsport was one of the many 80s action movies I grew up watching in the 90s and early 2000s. This movie
                did for me what Dragonball Z did for many of my contemporaries. It gets me fired up and grinning like crazy
                at the prospect of skillful and artful violence; the romantic idea of a warrior's code, and the tightly
                executed classic story of the "hero's journey". I must also say this movie would be half of what it is
                without the masterpiece soundtrack by Paul Hertzog. It was made back in the day where the soundtracks
                were long, and artist tracks interwove with the incidental music almost flawlessly.
            </p>
        </div>
        <li>Terminator 2 (1991)</li>
        <li>Clerks (1995)</li>
        <li class="expand">The Matrix (1999)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                There have been many criticisms of The Matrix franchise over the years by internet wiseguys and armchair
                critics. I have to remind myself that The Matrix is one of the few pieces of media I've taken in over
                the course of my life that is absolutely, 100% worth every bit of hype it's gotten. It's almost strange,
                because the other projects by the Wachowskis that I have seen were hit or miss, and that's an understatement.
                The Matrix had the era, the budget, the design, and the writing to define an era. The Matrix changed the world
                forever.
            </p>
        </div>
        <li class="expand">Napoleon Dynamite (2004)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                I feel like Napoleon Dynamite was one of those films that defined a genre, but the only movie belonging to
                said genre that I've seen. I think this movie came along at exactly the right time for a lot of kids growing up.
                I was 11 when it came out, so maybe a little early for me, but that meant I had my whole early teens ahead
                of me to spend quoting it and silently relate to all the awkward characters in my academic and suburban
                lives' moments of greatest shame. The movie is fantastic because even though it makes you cringe in
                sympathy, it manages to do what so few other movies do, which is to not stew in that awkwardness. It
                doesn't make the discomfort its reason for existence, but merely the primary way it conveys humor. Even
                further, it seems to go to lengths to show that EVERY character is awkward in their own right, so fuck it.
                Don't get mired in the tar pits of public shame - Napoleon didn't.
            </p>
        </div>
        <li class="expand">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                I saw this movie the first time a few years ago at the time of writing, making it my early 20s. I had
                no idea what to expect going in, but I was more than slightly jaded. Soon, the movie disarmed me almost
                completely. I know it's become one of those movies that is referred to cynically - as one of the parts
                of weird, toxic boy's "starterpack". But I don't give a fuck about that. Aside from maybe a few awkward
                lines of dialogue, this movie is an immersive, claustrophobic at times, agoraphobic at times, atmospheric,
                surreal and highly personal romance story built on top of a humble little science fiction story. Like
                Napoleon Dynamite, I feel it beautifully defines an era, the SAME era - but in a mostly different way.

        <li class="expand">Mercyful Fate - Don't Break the Oath (1984)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Some fateful cloudy day circa 2008, I headed to the local Half Price Books with my mother and brother.
                I had just begun my record collecting career, and as a fledgling  every release that could be considered metal or
                metal-adjacent was squarely in my sights. I was looking through the cassettes when I stumbled upon the
                completely galvanizing cover of "Don't Break The Oath". An armored warrior with devil horns, being
                completely engulfed in yellow flames while pointing determinedly towards the viewer. It was the perfect
                combination of dark, twisted, but yet beautiful occult visual language. I later listened to it, and the
                first few times I did I was genuinely torn between laughter and actual fear at the otherworldly sound
                of King Diamond's voice. Eventually I did go back, and became completely obsessed with everything Mercyful
                Fate for years to come. Hearing Michael Denner's guitar playing was like being struck by lightning to me.
                Their very purposeful but highly unusual song structure and riff composition was very much ahead of its time.
                Mercyful Fate are above all else, musical storytellers that have complete control of the listener as soon
                as they press "play".

        <li class="expand">Queensryche - Operation: Mindcrime (1988)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Sometime around the age of 14 (2007-ish) I picked up a half-yellowed copy of Operation: Mindcrime on
                cassette. After that, I listened to it so often that I like to say there was a point where I measured
                how much time had passed by what position of the cassette I was at.

        <li>Black Sabbath - Headless Cross (1989)</li>
        <li class="expand">Celtic Frost - Vanity/Nemesis (1990)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Whenever I think of this album, I cannot help but imagine myself in 2010 and 2011, spending half of my
                time at high school and then driving over to the local community college in my 1997 Ford Escort LX wagon
                to spend the other half (while dangerously and un-glamorously eating a sandwich on the way). The car had a
                tape player and a radio, and that was perfect for me and my burgeoning cassette collection of metal.

                If it weren't for Monotheist (2006), this would easily be my favorite Celtic Frost album. I love this
                album for the same reason I love the band Akercocke (though that comparison is probably backwards
                chronologically): Celtic Frost managed to synthesize the thrash brutality of their earlier releases
                with the melodic and dramatic elements they developed in the late 80s, making for an almost
                perfectly balanced album.

        <li>Anacrusis - Reason (1990)</li>
        <li class="expand">Linkin Park - Hybrid Theory (2000)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                I've relayed this anecdote other places too, but the first real CD I owned that I sought out myself was
                a burned copy of Hybrid Theory a classmate made for me in 3rd grade. I'll never, ever forget that gesture,
                because I had gotten used to my peers being unreliable and having the attention spans of mosquitos. So
                when I asked my then-friend Nick to burn me a CD of Linkin Park, my favorite band I'd heard on the radio
                at the time, I expected he'd completely forget by the next day. But to my surprise, he brought in a CD-R
                the next day with the words "ED'S LINKIN PARK CD" shakily scrawled on it in sharpie. Funny enough, the
                track list was out of order, but I didn't know or care. I like to joke to this day that that was the "true"
                track order because it was the one on the CD I played constantly growing up.

                The album is melodically genius, and I instinctively start to rap all the parts I can. It's one of those
                ones that's just burned into my brain.
