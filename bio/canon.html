    <ul>
        <li class="expand">Xenogears (1998, PS1)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Xenogears and Xenosaga are artistic high points in the video game medium. This game is known
            for helping define the renaissance that Japanese RPGs enjoyed in the late 90s. Unlike many games before
            or since, it combined many religious and psychological theories to create an extremely compelling narrative.
            </p>

        <li class="expand">Half-Life (1998, PC)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Half-Life defined my childhood. More importantly, it completely defined and revolutionized the first-
                person-shooter genre and spawned a vibrant modding community.
                With a robust engine, expansive, expressive and meaningful level design, it's no
                stretch to say that first person shooter games are still learning lessons it put forth all the way back
                in 1998.

        <li class="expand">Final Fantasy X (2001, PS2)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Final Fantasy X was my first ever JRPG. That alone guarantees I can never be objective about judging it,
                however I think its popularity is well deserved. In my opinion it is the quintessential Final Fantasy -
                great worldbuilding, beautiful characters, gorgeous soundtrack. For those who played Final Fantasy X
                at an impressionable age, Spira stays with them for a long time. "People die, and Yuna dances."

        </div>
        <li class="expand">Metal Gear Solid 2 (2001, PS2)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                I have a tattoo of the Big Shell on my left arm. Big whoop, right? I have many criticisms of this game
                and its creator, but that does not do anything to deny the massive impact it has had on me. It is the
                perfect post-modern mind explosion to immediately follow its prequel, Metal Gear Solid. Its predictions
                about the digital age continue to be relevant even at the time of writing this (2018).
            </p>
        </div>
        <li class="expand">The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (2004, PC)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Whenever I get burnt out on video games as a whole, I play a Trails game. Trails in the Sky is such a
                beautiful meditation on the JRPG genre. Released shortly after the late 90s RPG "renaissance", Falcom
                distilled the best qualities of said RPGs into one charming, streamlined, heat-wrenching experience. The
                localizations done in recent years by XSEED are nothing short of masterful. I recommend this game to people
                with an interest in "old school JRPGs" on a regular basis.
            </p>
        </div>
        <li class="expand">Final Fantasy XII (2006, PS2)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                If Final Fantasy X was my introduction to JRPGs, Final Fantasy XII brought it to a completely new level.
                It's difficult for me to describe how gorgeous this game is on every possible level. The environments are
                enrapturing. The characters almost take a backseat to them, but enjoy the same great writing and localization
                that is afforded for the game's worldbuilding and backstory. Sakimoto's soundtrack and Matsuno's scenario
                is exquisite. Everything is seemingly ornate and looked over several times. The whole game carries with it
                a strong sense of grandiose "high adventure" that I struggle to describe to others.
            </p>
        </div>
        <li class="expand">BioShock Infinite (2013, PC)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Bioshock Infinite was perhaps the first game I was ever obsessed with where I was aware of said obsession.
                After finishing the base game, but before the DLC came out, I filled a notebook page with my theory of
                Infinite's "timelines" in order to make sense of the tragic beauty of a game I had just played. Where
                Half-Life redefined the first person shooter, Bioshock Infinite re-defined it in an adventurous, narrative-
                focused way that didn't forget about the basic mechanics that made the genre so utterly satisfying.
            </p>
        </div>
        <li class="expand">Overwatch (2016, PC)</li>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Overwatch is the first online game I have regularly stuck with since release, pouring well over a hundred
                hours into it as of early 2018. An estranged college friend introduced me to it by showing me its first
                cinematic trailer before it had been released. I was expecting something unexciting, but the trailer had
                reinvigorated me in the tradition of the online FPS once again. At first exposure, I was quite
                interested by Widowmaker, Genji, and D.Va. This game is somewhat of a masterclass in character
                and UI design, as well as how to keep things performant and fresh after a long, long time playing.

        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Some fateful cloudy day circa 2008, I headed to the local Half Price Books with my mother and brother.
                I had just begun my record collecting career, and as a fledgling  every release that could be considered metal or
                metal-adjacent was squarely in my sights. I was looking through the cassettes when I stumbled upon the
                completely galvanizing cover of "Don't Break The Oath". An armored warrior with devil horns, being
                completely engulfed in yellow flames while pointing determinedly towards the viewer. It was the perfect
                combination of dark, twisted, but yet beautiful occult visual language. I later listened to it, and the
                first few times I did I was genuinely torn between laughter and actual fear at the otherworldly sound
                of King Diamond's voice. Eventually I did go back, and became completely obsessed with everything Mercyful
                Fate for years to come. Hearing Michael Denner's guitar playing was like being struck by lightning to me.
                Their very purposeful but highly unusual song structure and riff composition was very much ahead of its time.
                Mercyful Fate are above all else, musical storytellers that have complete control of the listener as soon
                as they press "play".
